INTRODUCTION
------------
This module provides integration with the Algolia service
(https://www.algolia.com), through Drupal's Search API. This module is intended
to be used by developers, as it does not currently provide any implementation of
an actual search interface. Only indexing is currently supported. As a result,
enabling that module will not have any visible effect on your application.
Search functionality may be implemented using the Algolia Javascript API.

Currently supported:
 * initial indexing of entities (see "Know problems")
 * re-indexing on node updates or through forced re-index action

Type of fields which have been successfully tested:
 * entity reference fields (either single or multivalued)
 * standard text fields containing either strings or integers (integer support
   is important for comparison functions in the search query)
 * geofield, address field components


REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires the following modules:
 * Search API (https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api)
