INSTALLING MODULES AND LIBRARIES
--------------------------------
 * Download the module and all of its dependencies. Move them to the contributed
   modules location in your tree (e.g. /modules/ or /modules/contrib/).

 * Install Algolia search client PHP library from https://github.com/algolia
   /algoliasearch-client-php via command line `composer require algolia/algoliasearch-client-php`

 * Enable the module's dependencies on the modules admin page url (/admin/modules).


CONFIGURING SEARCH API SERVER AND INDEX
---------------------------------------

 * On the Search API administration page (/admin/config/search/search-api), add
   a new server, select backend "Algolia", and check the "Enabled" checkbox.
   In the "Configure Algolia backend" section, fill in your Application ID and API key found in your Algolia dashboard on
   https://www.algolia.com.

 * On the Search API administration page (/admin/config/search/search_api), add
   a new index, enable it and select the server you just created in the previous
   section. The index name provided will be used to create a new index on the
   Algolia platform. Please read the "Known problems" section of the README.txt
   file for the latest updates about the type of entity supported.

 * On the "Fields" tab of your index
   (/admin/config/search/search_api/index/[YOUR INDEX NAME]/fields), check all
   the fields you want to have indexed in the Algolia index. At the very least,
   the entity ID field for the indexed entity type needs to be checked off (nid
   for nodes, uid for users, etc.). Please read the "Known problems" section of
   the README.txt file for the latest updates about the type of fields
   supported.

 * On the "Processors" of your index (/admin/config/search/search_api/index/[YOUR
   INDEX NAME]/processors), select the processors you want to apply before the data
   is being sent to Algolia's servers. A good starting combination could be
   "Entity status" (allowing you to Exclude unpublished content, unpublished comments and inactive users from being indexed.
   Please read the "Known problems" section of the README.txt file for
   the latest updates about the type of processor supported.


INDEXING CONTENT
----------------
* On your newly created index page, (/admin/config/search/search_api/index/[YOUR
  INDEX NAME]), click the "Index now" button. You should start seeing content
  populating the index in the Algolia dashboard on https://www.algolia.com.
